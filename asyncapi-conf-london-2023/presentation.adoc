Hello everyone, my name is Artur and I work for Adobe Journey Optimizer. I've been in the marktech technology space for the last 8 years. I'm a polyglot developer and architect for Adobe Journey Optimizer Edge Delivery.

Before we get started, I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak today and I want to thank the sponsors for making this event possible.
--

== Background
Adobe Journey Optimizer::
* Cloud based solution
* Personalized experiences at scale
* Omni-channel
* Right content at the right time

[.notes]

Before we delve into AsyncAPI and Modelina, I'd like to give you a bit of background about Adobe Journey Optimizer. Like many modern cloud solutions Adobe Journey Optimizer is based on a microservices architecture. We have quite a few applications running on the "edge". Running on the "edge" means that we are as close to our customer's customers as possible. To make sure that we deliver the right experience at the right time we need to ensure that "config" data like marketing campaigns, offers, and other business rules are available to our applications. Data is pushed from "hubs" to "edges" via Kafka.

== Edge Network

[.notes]
--
Here is quick overview of our current Edge Network. On the edge we have different applications that are covering different use cases like: personalization, experimentation, Machine Learning, etc. All these applications are consuming config data tha is published via Kafka.

Like most enterprises are go to solution for documenting architecture, onboarding and other engineering related processes, including integration details, is Confluence. We have Confluence pages that describe the data that is sent to Kafka. These pages are manually maintained by engineers. This is a very error prone process. Engineers are not always up to date with the latest changes and the documentation is not always accurate. This leads to a lot of confusion and frustration.

[.notes]
--
Some teams are using JSON Schema to document the payload that is sent over Kafka, however most of the time we see just some JSON samples in the WIKI and some tables with the field names and types. This is not very helpful for the consumers of the data. 
--

This leads to pain, suffering and agony, since the only source of truth is the code that actually sends the data over the wire instead of the WIKI pages.

Here is a quick example of a Confluence page with Kafka topics and a table with all the events being published.

Here is another Confluence page with the Kafka message in a pseudo JSON contract.

Pain points::
- Poor version control
- Code and docs out of sync
- Multiple sources of truth
- No tooling
- Nearly impossible to use any automation

We are at an AsyncAPI Conf so you might have guessed that the solution to our pain and suffering is AsyncAPI. It should be noted that at Adobe we are heavy users of OpenAPI, but for whatever reason AsyncAPI flew under the radar for some time.

As I already mentioned we are heavy users of Kafka. It is our go to messaging solution, but we are considering using AsyncAPI in other places where teams are using RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, JMS, etc.

We love AsyncAPI, it helped my team and we are actively evangelizing it within Adobe, we'll see how it goes :).
--

== Enlightenment
AsyncAPI killer features::
- Human readable
- Machine readable
- Awesome tooling
- Awesome community
- Extremely extensible and flexible

[.notes]
--
Just like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI is human and machine readable. It has awesome tooling and an awesome community. It is extremely extensible and flexible. Being part of Linux Foundation is a huge plus. We can be confident that AsyncAPI will thrive and we can bet on it.

== Modelina
image::ring-of-power.png[width=900,height=600]

[.notes]
--
So far I have been talking about AsyncAPI, however one of the reason that AsyncAPI was so successful within our teams is due to Modelina. Modelina proved to be quite a versatile tool. As I mentioned we are using OpenAPI quite heavily along with OpenAPI Generator. What we really liked about Modelina is that we can use one code-gen tool for OpenAPI, JSON Schema, AsyncAPI, which means that we can standardize on one tool.
--

== Modelina
Use cases::
- Generate classes from OpenAPI for the REST API
- Generate classes from AsyncAPI for Kafka publishing and consuming
- Generate classes from JSON Schema to store them in document DBs like MongoDB or CosmosDB

[.notes]
--
It is worth noting that while initially we intended to use Modelina just for AsyncAPI and Kafka we quickly realized that we can use it to automate code generation for our REST and data layer and use OpenAPI, JSON Schema and AsyncAPI as the source of truth. 
--

== Demo
image::architecture.png[width=700,height=500]

[.notes]
--
To make sure we are on the same page, here is a quick diagram showing the services that we are going to use in the demo. We have a service that is publishing data to Kafka and another service that is consuming the data from Kafka.
--

== Demo - services
Services::
- Kotlin Producer App
- Java Consumer App
- Scala Consumer App

== Demo - services
Service structure::
- `api/spec` - OpenAPI specification
- `api/external-specs` - AsyncAPI specifications, referenced from external repository
- `api/config` - code generation configuration

[.notes]
--
It should be noted that this structure is NOT enforced in any way. It is just a convention that we are using. To help teams to the right thing we have a GitHub template repository that they can use to bootstrap their services.

== Demo - for real :)

== Conclusion
Lessons learned::
- Small steps
- Don't be afraid to ask for help
- RTFM
- Use boring technology
- Give back to community

[.notes]
--
To conclude, I'd like to share some lessons learned::
- First of all, don't try to boil the ocean
- Start small and iterate
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. The AsyncAPI community is awesome and very helpful
- RTFM, AsyncAPI just like OpenAPI uses JSON Schema, so before adopting any of these specifications it won't hurt to read the docs and ensure that you understand the basics and use the best practices
- Use boring technology, there are a lot of awesome tools like Schema Registry, API Management Platforms, etc. For now we have sticked to simple tools like: Git, Convention over Configuration, using Git repo templates, and good old Makefiles for task automation, and it works great!
- To be a good citizen we should give back to the community, it can be a PR, a blog post, a talk, a bug report, anything that will make the AsyncAPI and its ecosystem better. In our case we are planning to contribute our Scala code gen to Modelina and we are looking forward to contribute to Kotlin and Java code gen.
