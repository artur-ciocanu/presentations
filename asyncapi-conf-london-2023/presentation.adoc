Before we delve into AsyncAPI and Modelina, I'd like to give you a bit of background about Adobe Journey Optimizer. Like many modern cloud solutions Adobe Journey Optimizer is based on a microservices architecture. We have quite a few applications running on the "edge". Running on the "edge" means that we are as close to our customer's customers as possible. To make sure that we deliver the right experience at the right time we need to ensure that "config" data like marketing campaigns, offers, and other business rules are available to our applications. Data is pushed from "hubs" to "edges" via Kafka.

Here is quick overview of our current Edge Network. On the edge we have different applications that are covering different use cases like: personalization, experimentation, Machine Learning, etc. All these applications are consuming config data tha is published via Kafka.
