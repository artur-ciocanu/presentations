Hello everyone, my name is Artur and I work for Adobe Journey Optimizer. I've been in the marktech technology space for the last 8 years.I'm a polyglot developer and architect for Adobe Journey Optimizer Edge Delivery.

Before we get started, I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak today and I want to thank the sponsors for making this event possible.

Before we delve into AsyncAPI and Modelina, I'd like to give you a bit of background about Adobe Journey Optimizer. Like many modern cloud solutions Adobe Journey Optimizer is based on a microservices architecture. We have quite a few applications running on the "edge". Running on the "edge" means that we are as close to our customer's customers as possible. To make sure that we deliver the right experience at the right time we need to ensure that "config" data like marketing campaigns, offers, and other business rules are available to our applications. Data is pushed from "hubs" to "edges" via Kafka.

Here is quick overview of our current Edge Network. On the edge we have different applications that are covering different use cases like: personalization, experimentation, Machine Learning, etc. All these applications are consuming config data tha is published via Kafka.

== The Mess

[.notes]
--
Like most enterprises are go to solution for documenting architecture, onboarding and other engineering related processes, including integration details, is Confuence. We have Confluence pages that describe the data that is sent to Kafka. These pages are manually maintained by engineers. This is a very error prone process. Engineers are not always up to date with the latest changes and the documentation is not always accurate. This leads to a lot of confusion and frustration.

== The Mess
image::json.png[width=600,height=400]

[.notes]
--
Some teams are using JSON Schema to document the payload that is sent over Kafka, however most of the time we see just some JSON samples in the WIKI and some tables with the field names and types. This is not very helpful for the consumers of the data.

== The Mess

[.notes]
--
This leads to pain, suffering and agony, since the only source of truth is the code that actually sends the data over the wire instead of the WIKI pages.

We are at an AsyncAPI conf so you might have guessed that the solution to our pain and suffering is AsyncAPI. It should be noted that at Adobe we are heavy users of OpenAPI, but for whatever reason AsyncAPI flew under the radar for some time.

As I already mentioned we are heavy users of Kafka. It is our go to messaging solution, but we are considering using AsyncAPI in other places where teams are using RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, JMS, etc.
